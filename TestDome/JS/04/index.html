        <p>An image gallery is a set of images with corresponding remove buttons. This is the HTML code for a gallery with two images:</p>
        <p>
            Implement the setup function that registers a click event handler and implements the following logic: When the button of class remove is clicked, its parent <div> element should be removed from the gallery.
            <br>For example, after the first image has been removed from the gallery above, it's HTML code should look like this:
        </p>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
